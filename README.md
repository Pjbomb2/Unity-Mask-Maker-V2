# Unity-Mask-Maker-V2
Complete from-scratch rewrite of my original CPU mask maker, but now on the GPU and with more features, and a better UI
Allows you to quickly create a mask from a pre-existing texture

## To Use:
Open the program from under the Window tab, called "Mask Creator"
</br></br>
Load your texture into the "Input Image" entry on the left of the new window
</br></br>
Select the upper bound color by clicking on the black square under the "Max Color" label, then click on the input texture to eyedropper that color
</br></br>
Repeat for the "Min Color" and "Background Color"
</br></br>
Click on the input texture to generate the initial mask
</br></br>
Once you are done, click on the "Output Mask" button to write the mask to a file; the final file will be next to the source texture's file
